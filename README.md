# Setup

1. Clone the repo and then cd into `arc_agi`
2. Set up `.env` with your credentials (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` and `XAI_API_KEY`). You don't need to set up all of them, just the ones you need.
4. Create a virtual environment with Python version 3.11 e.g. `python3.11 -m venv venv`
5. Activate the virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Check out src/submission.py and the parameters it accepts. For example, `python -m src.submission -v1` generates a submission file for the model's attempts on ARC-AGI-1 public eval set.

Here's a writeup of my approach. You can read it in https://ctpang.substack.com/p/arc-agi-2-sota-efficient-evolutionary.

# Introduction

In a world of impressive AI results ([IMO Gold](https://x.com/alexwei_/status/1946477742855532918); [88.1% on Graduate-level STEM questions](https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/gpqa-08-07-2025); [74.9% on Software Engineering tasks](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/)), one benchmark is still unsaturated. Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI), which was originally introduced by François Chollet in [On the Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547), remains a challenge that humans perform well on while machines struggle. On ARC-AGI-2, the second generation competition with a $1 million in prizes, no frontier models score above 16%.



Building upon the work of [Jeremy Berman](https://jeremyberman.substack.com/p/how-i-got-a-record-536-on-arc-agi), who achieved the SoTA result on the ARC-AGI-1 Public leaderboard, I designed a [DreamCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381)-inspired, LLM-assisted program synthesis system that can solve increasingly harder tasks by leveraging learned concepts in an expanding library of programs. My approach scored 77.1% on ARC-AGI-1 and 26.0% on ARC-AGI-2, both beating results of frontier models and previous bespoke systems. Furthermore, designed for efficiency, my system has the best performance-cost metric, breaking the existing Pareto frontier.

# Background

## ARC-AGI

[ARC-AGI](https://arcprize.org/) is a benchmark created to measure AI intelligence, specifically on its ability to adapt to novel scenarios that it cannot solve by memorization. Each ARC task has several training examples in the form of input/output grids of colored cells which encode some unwritten rules. The goal of an AI system is discovering those rules, and then applying them to test inputs to generate output grids. An AI solves a task if all of their generated outputs are the same as the expected outputs.

ARC-AGI-2, which was launched on 25 March 2025, is the next iteration which tests more advanced AI capabilities such as symbolic interpretation (can a machine interpret symbols as having meaning beyond their visual patterns), compositional reasoning (can a machine combine multiple learned rules that interact with each other), and contextual rule application (can a machine apply rules differently based on context). It is much more difficult as evidenced by the results of frontier models: on high test-time-compute setting, Grok-4 scores 16.0% on ARC-AGI-2 vs. 66.7% on ARC-AGI-1, GPT-5 scores 9.9% vs. 65.7%, while Claude Opus 4 scores 8.6% vs. 35.7%.

ARC-AGI is famously easy for humans but hard for AI. The average human scores 77% on ARC-AGI-1, and a panel of 10 random humans achieves 98–100% on both ARC-AGI-1 and 2, much better than leading-edge models. While one model (OpenAI's o3) achieved a similar score as an average human on ARC-AGI-1, it needed to spend $200 per task to do so. Meanwhile, no models have come close to human performance on ARC-AGI-2. ARC-AGI is the one benchmark where AI models still do not saturate.

The ARC-AGI challenge has four datasets: training, public eval, semi-private eval, and private eval. The purpose of the training set is teaching Core Knowledge Priors to an AI system, whose ability can then be evaluated on the public eval set. The semi-private eval set was calibrated to have the same difficulty as the public eval set, but researchers need to coordinate with the ARC-Prize team to test their model on it in a Kaggle notebook that runs at most 12 hours. The goal is to minimize test data leakage and contamination. Finally, the private eval set is only accessible via the no-internet-access [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025) and has never been exposed to third-party APIs.

The confusion about a model's performance on ARC-AGI often stems from teams reporting performance on different datasets. Unless otherwise specified, all accuracy scores in this post are evaluated on the semi-private eval set.

## ARC-AGI-1 SoTA

While frontier models perform poorly on their own, ARC-AGI researchers often leverage them as part of a bespoke solution. The best performing approach for ARC-AGI-1 was Jeremy Berman's [Evolutionary Test-time Compute](https://jeremyberman.substack.com/p/how-i-got-a-record-536-on-arc-agi). By "having Sonnet 3.5 generate a bunch of Python transform functions, testing them against challenge examples, and then using the best-performing functions to create new prompts for generating even better solutions," Berman achieved 53.6% accuracy on ARC-AGI-1, which was SoTA in December 2024.



This approach, together with [Ryan Greenblat](https://blog.redwoodresearch.org/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt)'s [AlphaCode](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/competitive-programming-with-alphacode/)-styled solution, validated using LLM-generated programs to tackle ARC-AGI. They showed that even though frontier models could not solve many tasks in one shot, using them to generate a large number of programs per task can improve performance. But one limitation is efficiency: Evolutionary Test-time Compute generates up to 500 python functions per task, while the number for Greenblat's system is around 8,000. Ultimately, these systems treat each ARC task as an isolated problem. When they discover a solution, they do not re-use learned concepts in the next task. But ARC-AGI specifically tests models' understanding of Core Knowledge. Once a system "learns" gravity from task A, we would want it to apply the concept in task B if task B tests projectile motion prediction. Not leveraging previously discovered concepts makes search inefficient. As compositional reasoning (combining different concepts to solve a problem) is a major criterion for ARC-AGI-2, inefficient search means these systems either cannot find the right programs or need to spend a lot to do so because they need to re-learn every concept for every task.

## DreamCoder

While researching how to address this limitation, I came across a 2020 paper D[reamCoder: Growing generalizable, interpretable knowledge with wake-sleep Bayesian program learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381). DreamCoder is a neurosymbolic program synthesizer that solves tasks (defined as input/output pairs) by iteratively building up a library of programs. Starting from a library of primitives (think axiomatic functions) defined by a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), DreamCoder uses a "wake-sleep" algorithm to alternate between 1) generating programs with a neural network (recognition model) and the library to attempt tasks and 2) growing the library with more advanced programs and improving the recognition model.

DreamCoder has one stage in the Wake phase and two stages in the Sleep phase:

1) Wake

- A neural network, called recognition model, proposes candidate programs based on current library and task.

2) Sleep: Abstraction

- Expand the library with more advanced functions based on solution programs found during waking

- Refactor programs to abstract out common components. The resulted routine is added to the library if it minimizes the description length of the library plus the description lengths of the refactoring

3) Sleep: Dreaming

- Train the recognition model to predict the best programs p_x for tasks x with the updated library via Fantasies and Replays

- Fantasies: Sample programs p from the current library. For a task x, update x_output to be p(x_input). Train the recognition model such that p has a better chance to be surfaced for task (x_input, p(x_input)).

- Replays: Recall tasks x solved during waking and set p_x to be the solution program found. Train the recognition model such that p_x has a better chance to be surfaced for task x.

DreamCoder has been tried in the ARC-AGI challenge before by [Mikel Bober-Irizar and Soumya Banerjee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03507). They handcrafted 77 primitives for their Perceptual Abstraction & Reasoning Language (PeARL) and scored 4.5% on the ARC-AGI-1 public eval set.

# Motivation

Evolutionary Test-time Compute and DreamCoder have opposite strengths and weaknesses.

## Evolutionary Test-time Compute

Strength:

-Scalable. LLMs can generate an arbitrary number of diverse and valid programs.

Weakness:

-Knowledge learned from one task is not transferred to another.

##DreamCoder

Strength:

-Library of programs keeps evolving and is used across tasks.

Weakness:

-Programs are polymorphically typed λ-calculus expressions, which are not Turing-complete. The set of programs it can generate is smaller and less diverse than an LLM.

Handcrafted DSL means a lot of human engineering is required to get started. This is concerning in two ways. First, human intelligence is embedded into how the language is designed. If a system performs well on a task, it's unclear if the system is generalizing or the solution is already encoded in the DSL choice. In addition, handcrafted systems run contrary to the [bitter lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html).

I decided to combine these two ideas: using LLMs to generate programs in Python (a Turing-complete language), growing system expertise by adding promising programs to a library, and including the current best program from the library in the LLM prompt to search for a better solution.

#My Approach

##Architecture

Starting from an empty library, my system loops through each task to prompt an LLM for Python program(s) that can solve all of the training examples. I used the same prompt as Jeremy Berman and Ryan Greenblat which requires the LLM to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Each input/output grid is represented in multiple formats, namely grid dimensions, Base64 image encoding, ASCII and Python nested list. One addition I made is including in the prompt the current best program in the library. My system computes a primary accuracy score (how many correct training examples) and a secondary accuracy score (average cell-level accuracy on the training examples) for every program in the library on a task, and includes the best one in the prompt (first sort by primary score; tie-break by secondary score).

Out of all programs returned by the LLM, the one with the best primary and secondary accuracy scores is added to the library. The system then moves on to the next task with an expanded library until all tasks have been attempted once. The system then either starts from the first task again or ends, depending on the user-provided rounds parameter.

Notice there are several differences between my approach and DreamCoder:

1. DSL choice: instead of handcrafting primitives, my library is originally empty. No need for human engineering to get started.

2. Recognition model: recall the recognition model has two responsibilities in DreamCoder: identifying useful programs from the library and composing candidate programs.

-identifying useful programs from the library: my system uses accuracy scores heuristics. I also tried using a neural network and got promising results, but ultimately didn’t use it in the final system because of Kaggle runtime constraints. More on this in Next Steps.

-composing candidate programs: use LLM

3. Sleep (Abstraction): instead of adding functions to the library by refactoring common components of found solutions during waking, the most promising program returned by the LLM is added to the library.

4. Sleep (Dreaming): recognition model is now part heuristics score and part LLM. This stage is skipped because no model weights have to be updated

##Experiment

I experimented with LLM choice, prompt format, and program selection heuristics on 40 randomly selected ARC-AGI-1 training tasks. The system ran for five rounds with the LLM generating one program per task.

1. Model: the most recent generation of models (GPT-5 and Grok-4) are much better.

2. Program Output Difference: whether to include failed training examples and the difference between expected outputs and actual outputs in the prompt. Experiments showed including this information significantly improves performance. Providing more context is almost always better.

3. Score-weighted Program Selection: instead of sorting library programs first by primary accuracy score and then by secondary accuracy score for program selection, I tried summing the two scores, converting the sums into probabilities using softmax, and then sampling programs. Exploration is encouraged since the program with the best scores would not always be used.

4. Number of Selected Programs in Prompt: how many programs to be selected from the library.

Based on the experiments and [Grok-4's outperformance](https://arcprize.org/leaderboard) on the leaderboard, I decided to use Grok-4 with program output difference, score-weighted program selection, and two selected programs in the prompt for the final submission run.

##Result

In order to teach the system Core Knowledge, I first ran it on the ARC-AGI-2 public training set of 1,000 tasks with parameters of 1 round and 1 program generated per task. This training seeded the library with 538 programs (note: this is fewer than 1,000 because the API sometimes timed out or returned invalid programs). Next, the system was run on the semi-private set for 2 rounds. In each round, 5 programs were generated per task.

My system outperformed the frontier models on both ARC-AGI-1 and 2. While frontier models cost less per task, my system is more efficient and breaks the performance-cost Pareto frontier. Also, my approach only requires 10 LLM calls per task compared to Berman's 500 and Greenblat's 8,000 with a better accuracy on ARC-AGI-1. One caveat is they used the last generation of models (Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o respectively) while I used Grok-4. Using GPT-4o's $0.05 and Claude Sonnet 3.7's $0.058 cost per task on the ARC-AGI-1 leaderboard (which should be an underestimation since their prompts are more comprehensive; [Claude Sonnet 3.7 costs the same as Sonnet 3.5](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview#model-pricing)), the estimated cost per task of Berman's and Greenblat's solutions was $29 and $400 respectively, while mine was $2.56 in ARC-AGI-1.

I also want to acknowledge the similarities between my approach and Google DeepMind's [AlphaEvolve](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/): both use LLM to generate more advanced programs to expand a library. While I came up with the idea independently (here's my [first commit](https://github.com/epang080516/arc_agi/commit/3c7c5d82bdbf187ff237213cd18bbde336a81b1e) on 8 May 2025 while AlphaEvolve was published on 14 May 2025), their approach of marking components to evolve instead of evolving whole programs and using dynamic prompts and ensemble LLMs is very interesting. These ideas could potentially improve my system.
